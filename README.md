# Singly Linked List and Stack Implementation in C++

## Description

This project implements two fundamental data structures in C++:

1. **Singly Linked List**: A template-based singly linked list that supports various operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and displaying elements.
2. **Stack**: A stack of integers implemented using the `std::vector` container, supporting typical stack operations like push, pop, top, and calculating the average of elements.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **`Single_Linked_List.h`**: Header file containing the template class for the Singly Linked List.
- **`Stack_Vector.h`**: Header file containing the declaration of the `Stack` class.
- **`Stack_Vector.cpp`**: Implementation of the `Stack` class methods.
- **`main.cpp`**: Main program that provides an interactive menu for performing operations on the Singly Linked List and Stack.
- **`README.md`**: This file containing instructions and information about the project.
List Operations -
  1. Insert at Front: Adds a new element at the beginning of the list.
  2. Insert at Back: Adds a new element at the end of the list.
  3. Insert at Index: Inserts an element at a specified index. If the index is beyond the list size, the element is added at the end.
  4. Remove at Index: Removes the element at the specified index.
  5. Find Element: Searches for an element and returns its index if found.
  6. Get Front Element: Retrieves the first element of the list.
  7. Get Back Element: Retrieves the last element of the list.
  8. Check if List is Empty: Checks whether the list has any elements.
  9. Get Size of List: Returns the number of elements in the list.
  10. Display List: Shows all elements in the list.
  11. Return to Main Menu: Goes back to the main menu.
Stack Operations -
  Push Element: Adds an integer to the top of the stack.
  1. Pop Element: Removes the top element from the stack.
  2. Get Top Element: Retrieves the top element without removing it.
  3. Check if Stack is Empty: Checks whether the stack has any elements.
  4. Get Size of Stack: Returns the number of elements in the stack.
  5. Get Average of Stack Elements: Calculates and returns the average value of the stack's elements.
  6. Display Stack: Shows all elements in the stack.
  7. Return to Main Menu: Goes back to the main menu.
